I got a lot of things right now, the UI link to uf functions probably gonna be next patch, so yeah I'm trying ok?
In other themes, now fflush to fpurge conversion is easier, just change a line from comment to acctual code,
It's in func_gerais.c in one of the first lines, theres a explication there.
Thx for reading =)
